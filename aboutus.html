        <h2>Brief Background</h2>
        <p>In 1994, the <b>World Council of Credit Union (WOCCU)</b> was here in the Philippines. This trade organization of the international Credit Union System,
          in partnership with the Freedom from Hunger (FFH) founded by the Office of the Micro-Enterprise of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
          initiated a project in the Philippines known as <b>Credit Union Empowerment and  Strengthening (CUES) Philippines</b>. The project was based in Mindanao, particularly in Davao City.
        </p>
        <p>
          CUES Philippines reformed the landcape of credit cooperatives following ist goals to improve the performance of the credit cooperatives and to provide financial services to the segments of the population who cannot access credit.
        </p>  
        <p>
          The project focuses on two major thrusts: <b>Model Credit Union Building (MCUB)</b> and <b>Savings and Credit with Education (SCWE)</b>. The Model Credit Union Building is technoology-based that aims at stabilizing the cooperatives by providing safe and sound credit and savings services. Its major component is the <b>PEARLS Monitoring System</b> that performs calculations on 46 financial ratios. These cooperative partners that successfully use the PEARLS Monitoring System were awarded the <b>FOCCUS Brand</b>. On the other hand, the Savinbgs and credit with Education (SCWE) is a financial education service designed for low income but economically active women wo are capable of successfully engaging in micro-enterprise.

        <p>
          The integration of MCUB and SCWE technology to the cooperative made CUES  Philippines unique from the other credit union strengthening initiatives in the country. CUES Philippines aimed not to direct partners, but to train and help become financially outstanding cooperatives by providing financial tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the project was ending, CUES Philippines and its partner cooperative saw the need of contuinig the program using the same technology because  of its strategic advantage and impeccable assistance to them. Thus, <span>MODEL COOPERATIVE NETWORK (MCN)</span> was organized.
        </p>
        <p>
          MCN is a federation of savings and credit cooperatives in the Philippines  duly registered by the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) last September 7, 2004. It awards the use of the trademark <img src="img/FOCCUSBRANDLOGO.png" alt="Sample Image" style="width:100px;"> to affiliates that have achieved and maintanied the International Prudential Standards in their operations. These standards help primary cooperativs ensure that their members' money is safe and will grow, offer cooperative and quality financial services to its members and ensure sustainability of the cooperative operations 
        </p>
        <p>
         The federation helps cooperatives achieve and maintain their FOCCUS-Brand status through strict adherence to financial Disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequent to the ambitious platform and blueprint, MCN continues to uphold, promote and protect the integrity of te FOCCUS Brand, MCN's primary servise is supervision and monitoring of the member cooperatives in order to ensure SAFETY and SUSTAINABILITY. The integrity of the cooperativs is monitored and assessed based on the context of Model Credit Union Building (MCUB) guidelines.   
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004, the CUES Philippines project ended. The cooperatives that were partners of the project were left with the challenge of sustaining the gains they have achieved. The cooperatives decided to form a federation to continue the monitoring and training services that CUES Philippines provided. The federation was named Model Cooperative Network (MCN).

        <img src="img/foccus (1).png" alt="foccus">
        <p><span>FOCCUS</span> stands for <span>Finance Organization achieving Certified Union Standards</span>. <i>It is owned by MCN by virtue of the Deed of Transfer from</i> <b>WOCCU</b>.
          The use of trademark is regulated by MCN. Cooperative who fail to maintain the prudential standards set by the federation are barred from using the
          trademark. MCN has qualified examiners who monitor the performance of the affiliate coorperatives on a monthly basis. Thus, cooperatives leaders
          are made aware of the deficiences as well as the strengths in the cooperative operation and take corrective actions before they become detrimental.
